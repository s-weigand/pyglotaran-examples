- K-Matrix (Megacomplex) as rendered flow schematics
- Save initial spec data to model and parameters (no print_md)

- data selection in model file (pre-processing)

### Project management
- SQL in core
- DVC as additional plugin

## Documentation
- terminology overview table

### pyglotaran-extras
- default no heatmap (performance?) -> plots are slow in general 30% only for creation
- easier way to display k_matrix of megacomplex (do all have a k_matrix? different name? jÃ¶rn changes?)
-

## case studies
- CK
- DPS1
- bacterial reaction center (glotaran + notebook)
