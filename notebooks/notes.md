# Usage notes
## Meeting (2021-03-26)
### Before meeting
- Python script for legay glotaran download and start scripts?
- Proper K-matrix `repr` as matrix (transform: full <=> reduced)
- K-matrix as flow scheme (`graphviz`?)
- Infer megacomplex if there is only 1 K-matrix? (looks like this is redundant information)
- Proper `repr` for `Result` (inital-/optimized Parameters, ..., t-values?)
- Documentation on how th write models lacks a lot (need to read source code/PRs)
- make model also evaluate expressions (e.g. `(s2, s3): {expr:$scaling.a1*$kinetic.4}` maybe should be even `(s2, s3): $scaling.a1*$kinetic.4`)

### Next
#### PS1
- Area constrain to estimate kinetic.2 and scaling.{1,2}
- CK case study

#### Plan
- Progress plan

# Thesis orga
## TODO
## Done
- Decide on a temp title of the thesis for registration (e.g. "Global Target Analysis of Time-Resolved Spectroscopy")
